#  File:  rtl8812AU_driver_install.sh.txt
#  Purpose:  Install Realtek RTL8812AU chipset linux kernel driver for AC1200 (801.11ac) Wireless Dual-Band USB adapter, within a RPM distro
#            NB:  I did include notes for dpkg distros as well; maybe in the future I'll include an if state to detect versions
